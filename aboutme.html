                Hi! My name is <strong>Ryan</strong>, and I have been actively going to the gym since 2020. I made this website because
                <br> going to the gym for the first time can be scary. I remember my first time entering the gym, nervous and scared that
                <br> others were judging me. I didn't have a structured workout routine, and for the first week, I didn't know what to do.
                <br>
                <br>However, as time went on, I began to find a groove, and figured out which exercises best suited me. Even to this day, I
                <br> make changes in my workouts, and that's totally okay! The most important part of going to the gym is starting. This 
                <br> website lists many of my personal favorite exercises that I do, all categorized into its own muscle groups. Note that
                <br> the workouts listed aren't the only ones you can do; like I said, these are just some of my favorite ones. Hopefully,
                <br> this website can get you started on your gym journey. Best of luck!
