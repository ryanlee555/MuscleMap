                Knowing which workouts to do comes with trial and error. The more important aspect about working out is to determine
                <br> which split you want to follow throughout your week. If you have more time on your hands and want to workout 5-6
                <br> times a week, you might want to consider the PPL, Arnold, or Bro Split. If you are busier (which is completely fine),
                <br> the upper/ lower body or full body split might be best for you. Finding the right split that fits into your schedule
                <br> is very important, and I will give you some sample workouts for each potential split. Again, there are an infinite
                <br> amount of customizable splits that you can do. These are just some of the most popular ones to help get you started
                <br> formulating your own one, and hopefully in the future, you will be able to customize your own split.

                <p style= "color:rgb(246, 244, 244)" >
                    PPL stands for Push, Pull, Legs. Push indicates any muscle movements that require a pushing motion; this includes
                    <br> chest, shoulders, and triceps. On the other hand, Pull indicates any muscle movements that require a pulling motion;
                    <br> back and biceps. Push Pull Legs are considered one of the most popular workout splits, because it evenly hits each muscle
                    <br> group consisteny. Below is a sample of a sample PPL day in a week.

                    The Arnold Split is a workout routine that was popularized by the king of bodybuilding himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
                    <br> The workout consists of three separate days: chest and back, shoulders and arms, and legs. The Arnold split is another
                    <br> very popular workout split, as you are able to hit all muscle groups consistently, similar to PPL. My personal split consists of 
                    <br> doing PPL on Mon-Wed, and Arnold on Thu-Sat, with a rest day on Sunday. These are some sample workouts that follow the Arnold split.

                    A full body split targets all major muscle groups in a single session. While it may be tougher to hit all muscle groups evenly, it
                    <br> is a great alternative split if you don't have too much time in your day. Oftentimes, compound lifts are performed first, with isolated 
                    <br> movements being later. Here are some sample full body workouts, one favoring the upper body and the other favoring the lower body.

                    An upper and lower body split is divided into two days, one targeting solely your upper body, and the other your lower body.
                    <br> Similarly to the full body split, the upper and lower is a good alternative for a short workout split. I believe that an upper and
                    <br> lower body split is slightly better, however, because you are able to target more muscles in separate days. Below are a few sample
                    <br> workouts for this split.

                    Finally, one of the most controversial splits: the Bro split. The bro split separates each muscle group into its own respective days.
                    <br> So, one day would focus only on chest, the next day will be back, and so on and so forth. While the bro split is great in hitting
                    <br> each muscle group very intensely, the only downside is that each muscle group is targeted only once a week, which is not very optimal.
                    <br> However, some bodybuilders use this split, so it really depends on each person. Here is an example of a potential bro split you can do.
